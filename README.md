With this script it is possible to open and close doors (ox_doorlock) automatically at certain times.

This offers more dynamics in the role play, for example in stores.

In the config.lua any number of doors can be created with their own times.

To use this script, ox_doorlock is required.

Updates:
1.1.
Jobs and groups can open or close doors by command
